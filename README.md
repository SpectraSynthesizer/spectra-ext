# Spectra Synthesizer Extensions
This repository contains extensions for the Spectra synthesizer tool. The extensions are Eclipse plug-ins and are independant of each other:
- Symbolic counter strategy generator
- Well separation checker
- Repair for unrealizable specifications
- Rich controller walker
- Vacuity checker

In order to integrate any of the extensions into your working copy of Eclipse with Spectra tools installed:
- `git clone` the repository into your computer.
- Import relevant projects into your workspace.
- Rebuild from Eclipse.
